      "1. Cook the rice: Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a medium pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil, add a pinch of salt, then stir in the rice. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and water is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and set aside.\n",
      "2. Prepare the chicken: In a small bowl, mix smoked paprika, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Rub this spice mixture evenly over the chicken breasts. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 6-7 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from skillet and let rest for a few minutes before slicing.\n",
      "3. Make the chipotle sauce: In the same skillet, add the minced chipotle peppers and a splash of olive oil. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Return the sliced chicken to the skillet, toss to coat in the chipotle sauce, and heat through.\n",
      "4. Assemble the bowls: Divide the cooked rice among serving bowls. Top with black beans and corn. Add slices of the chipotle chicken on top, spoon some of the remaining sauce over the chicken.\n",
      "5. Garnish and serve: Squeeze fresh lime juice over each bowl, sprinkle with chopped cilantro and shredded cheese. Add a dollop of sour cream if desired. Serve immediately for a warm, flavorful meal.\n",
